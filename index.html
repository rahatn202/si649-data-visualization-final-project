      <h1>Examining the Drug Overdose Death Epidemic </h1>
      <p>
        Drug overdose deaths have emerged as a major public health crisis in the United States. This narrative explores
        key trends and insights into overdose mortality rates from 1999 to 2022, evaluates the effects of policy
        interventions over time, and investigates potential correlations between overdose deaths and unemployment rates.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2> From Coast to Heartland: How Overdose Deaths Vary Across the U.S.</h2>
      <p>
        The tile map highlights sharp contrasts in overdose death rates across states. West Virginia (29.0 deaths per
        100,000) and Maryland (17.5) reported some of the highest averages from 1999 to 2022, while Hawaii (4.4) and
        Nebraska (2.7) maintained much lower rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Missouri, historically limited in Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PMP) regulations, consistently faced
        higher overdose death rates than many peers. Selecting a state reveals how local trends have evolved alongside
        national patterns. For example, Washington, once below the national average, experienced a sharp rise over the
        past two decades.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Who Is Most Affected? Exploring Demographic Trends in Overdose Deaths</h2>
      <p>
        Across years, the overall trend in drug overdose death rates shows a steady increase nationally. This pattern
        is consistently reflected when broken down by demographic groups and sex.
      </p>
      <p>Although absolute overdose death rates differ across racial groups and between males and females, the general
        upward trend remains evident across all categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, males consistently experience higher overdose death rates compared to females, and certain
        racial groups such as American Indian & Alaska Native populations and White populations report higher rates than
        others. These trends suggest that while the magnitude of risk varies by demographic factors, the broader
        escalation of overdose mortality is a shared national experience.
      </p>
      <div id="chart2" class="chart-container"></div>
      <span>Fig.2: Overdose Death Rates by Demographic</span>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How Overdose Death Rates and Unemployment Rates Compare Across States?</h2>
      <p>
        Ghertner, & Groves, in The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' APSE Research Brief states that "National measures of opioid prescribing and 
        substance use have been consistently rising since the early 2000s. Part of this rise corresponded with economic declines; however, 
        rates continued to rise even after economic indicators showed improvement. The increase at the national level masks variation in 
        rates across the country." 
      </p>
      <p>Our analysis also showed that the opioid overdose death rates have been increasing over the years which 
        can be seen by dragging the slider. The color of the states becomes darker as we move the slider to the right.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The figure 3, an interactive chart, provides an opportunity to explore the yearly trend of opioid overdose death date 
        and unemployement for years 2005 to 2014. The bar chart on the right shows the trend of unemployment rate by month in 
        a selected state and year. The map on the left shows the opioid overdose death rate by state for the selected year. The 
        states with light gray color indicate that thoses states do not have data for certain years. 
      </p>
      <p>From our analysis, it appears
        that <b>Michigan</b> had the highest unemployment rate <b>14.3%</b> in June and July of year 2009 and <b>Hawaii</b> had the lowest 
        unemployment rate of <b>2.4%</b> in January 2007. The state with the highest opioid overdose death rate is <b>West Virginia</b> with
        <b>31.6%</b> death rate in 2014. The state with lowest opioid overdose death rate is <b>Mississippi</b> with <b>1.4%</b> death rate in 2005.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Comparison between Overdose Death Rate, Poverty Rate and Unemployment Rate</h2>
      <p>
        The figure 4 is aimed to explore the trend of opioid overdose death rate with state poverty rate and unemployemnt rate in order to 
        identify any relationship between opioid overdose death and the other two factors. The chart also shows that West Virginia has the 
        highest average opioid overdose death rate of 21.83, which is indicated by the biggest size of the circle and Mississippi has the highest
        poverty rate of 14.3, indicated by the darkest brown color. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>North Dakota</b> has the lowest average opioid overdose death rate of <b>0.96%</b>, samllest
        size of the circle at the bottl of the chart. The <b>New Hampshire</b> has the lowest average poverty rate of <b>4.4%</b>, the one with the lightest 
        color. It appears that there might be some correlation between opioid overdose death rate and poverty rate darker and bigger circles 
        vs lighter and smaller circles, but it needs to be further explored.

  <h2>Impacts of Policy Interventions</h2>
  <p>
    Over the past two decades, opioid-related overdose deaths have risen dramatically, prompting state governments to adopt a variety of policy measures aimed at prevention and harm reduction. 
    Among the most common interventions are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Opioid Related Controls: State laws limiting opioid prescriptions</b></li>
    <li><b>Harm Reduction: Naloxone overdose prevention laws</b></li>
    <li><b>Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs)</b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    While these measures aim to mitigate opioid misuse and prevent overdose deaths, it remains unclear how effective they are in curbing the rising trend of opioid-related mortality across different states.
  </p>

  <p>
    The interactive visualization allows users to investigate the relationship between major opioid-related policy implementations and overdose death rates (ODDR) over time. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By selecting different policies and states, users can observe whether the introduction of specific interventions corresponds to any noticeable changes in overdose death trends.
  </p>

  <div id="chart3" class="chart-container"></div>

  <p>
    As said in article <i>Effectiveness of Policies for Addressing the US Opioid Epidemic: A Model-Based Analysis from the Stanford-Lancet Commission on the North American Opioid Crisis</i>, 
    “Reduced prescribing and increasing excess opioid disposal programs would reduce total deaths, but would lead to more heroin deaths in the short term.  Combined interventions would lead to greater increases in life years, QALYs, and deaths averted, although in many cases the results are subadditive. …… Expanded health services for individuals with opioid use disorder combined with PMPs and reduced opioid prescribing would moderately lessen the severity of the opioid crisis. 
    Tragically, even with improved public policies, significant morbidity and mortality is inevitable.”
  </p>

    <h2>Impacts of Policy Interventions</h2>
    <p>
      States that adopted opioid prescribing limits and monitoring programs earlier often saw reductions in opioid
      prescribing and overdose death rates. However, effects vary widely by region and population. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul> 
        <b>Opioid Related Controls</b>

    </p>
      <b>Harm Reduction</b>
      <li>
      <a href="https://pdaps.org/datasets/laws-regulating-administration-of-naloxone-1501695139">Naloxone Overdose Prevention Laws</a>
    </li>
      <p>Administering naloxone hydrochloride (“naloxone”) can reverse an opioid overdose and prevent unintentional death.</p>

      <a href="https://pdaps.org/datasets/pdmp-implementation-dates">PDMP Implementation Dates</a>
    </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
      Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) collect patient-specific prescription information in centralized databases 
      in an effort to reduce the misuse of controlled substances.
    </p>
      <p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
      From our analysis, it doesn't appear that there is any direct connection of overdose death with poverty and unemployment. Hence, our 
      assumption is there could be some external factors that might be driving the opioid overdose epidemic, but due to time constraints, we 
      couldn't explore all possible factors. We didn't have enough data available to explore in depth. There were a lot of missing data for 
      unemployment for many states and the data was only available from 2005 to 2014. We have made comparisons for the years the data was available.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Results/Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Addressing the opioid crisis requires a comprehensive approach that includes prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support 
      strategies. Continued monitoring and data-driven policy interventions are critical to mitigating the public health impacts of this epidemic.
